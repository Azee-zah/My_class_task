#Basic usage of print ()
print("Hello, World!")
print("Welcome to Python programming.")
# Using print () with variables
name = "Azeezat"
age = 25
print("Name:" , name)
print("Age:", age)
# Using f-string with print()
name = "Bola"
score = 92
print(f"{name} scored {score} in the exam.")
# Using string concatenation
first_name = "Ada"
last_name = "Lovelace"
print("Full name: " + first_name + " " + last_name)
# comma vs concatenation
print("Hello, World!")
print("Hello" + " " + "world!" )
